        <li>Click the bottom right to open the station panel</li>

    <p>Use the playlist and station panels to create a station</p>
    <p>Everybody that visits that station will hear it, in sync ðŸŽµ</p>
    <p class="noMobile">The main process works through your Spotify queue. In the backend for a station, a database keeps track of the currently playing song and when it started. am_radio will seek to the time it's been since the track started playing, and queue up the next one whenever the current one ends.</p>
