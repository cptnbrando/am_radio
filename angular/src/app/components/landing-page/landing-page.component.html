            am_radio uses the Spotify Playback SDK and the Spotify Web API to create live radio stations from submitted Spotify playlists. It does this by storing the Spotify URI of submitted playlists in a backend server. Only public playlists can be accessed by the Web API/SDK, so only publicly accessable playlist URIs will be stored, and only if a user wishes to create a station. You may use am_radio without creating a station, and no data will be stored anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also some cookies involved. When you successfully log in to am_radio, a Spotify access token will be generated and stored as a cookie on your device. This token expires after a set time, and am_radio will update the cookie with a fresh access token automatically. This is the only cookie I have implemented. The Spotify Playback SDK uses some cookies that I cannot control. This app uses Google Analytics to monitor user data, which may use cookies as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this app with very special care to store minimal data. am_radio will never store any data other than public Playlist URIs and user generated Station information. While it never stores other information, it may use and parse other User information provided by the Spotify Web API, including public User display names and URIs, public library details such as public Playlists and saved Tracks, and Player information like track position and repeat settings.
